For these parameters:

T2P =  -3.21012003479
for dt = 0.0001 ->  -32101.2003479

Therefore we can safely samples using 10,000 points again. Nice.

So..to run on BC3: 

	> single parameter set vs nosie (pID=0? nsamples = 100,1000,10000)
	> single parameter set vs nsamples (pID=0 noise=10,20,50)

	for both of the above, compare results to mean interaction strength during simulation (this must be saved in the results)


	> ensemble of parameter sets vs noise (nsamples = 100,1000,10000)
	> ensemble of parameter sets vs nsamples (noise = 10,20,50)
	
	for these cases must calculate relative error from mean interaction strength


N.B. change noise intensity workings!


And...

	Range sampling:
		> example of this for single linear and single HII run. With and without noise...perhaps enough...
